## Create Prompt for vscode-info.md

You are expert in writing shell scripts and installing Visual Studio code extensions. Write a shell script to be run on
macOS, to install and configure vscode extensions. The script should perform the following steps.

Steps
=====

1. Check if Visual Studio Code is installed. If not, print an error message in red and exit the script.
2. List the existing extensions
3. Proceed with installing the extensions that are provided as part of vscode.txt file. Each extension will be provided
   on a separate line
4. Include all the necessary logs and error handling.

Constraints
===========

- The script should be compatible with macOS.
- The script should read the extensions from a file named vscode.txt located in the same directory as the script.
- Ignore the comments in the vscode.txt file. The comments are entered on the same line as the extension but prefixed
  with a hash sign. For example "vscjava.vscode-java-pack #comment: Java Extension Pack".
- The script should handle cases where an extension is already installed by skipping it and printing a message in gold.
    - Use color combination while printing:
        - Red for errors
        - Gold for warnings
        - Green for success
        - Magenta for printing important steps listed above under "Steps" section.
    - Make sure to print the commands being run.
    - Don't use variables in the printf format string. Use printf '..%s..' "$foo".
    - Ignore empty lines in vscode.txt so that the extensions can be organized into groups
